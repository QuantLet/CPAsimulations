Description: ‘Performs the Penalized Adaptive Method (PAM), a combination of propagation-separation approach and a SCAD penalty, to fit a model to a simulated data with two pre-defined change points. Computes the percentage of correctly identifing the homogeneous intervals.’

Keywords: ‘linear model, regression, SCAD penalty, bic, change points, simulations, bootstrap’
